## Summary:
Started by ownself learning the basics of HTML and CSS in 2010, as a tool to create useful new products and realize own creativity. It was my hobby, not my main job.  

Today I decided to devote all my time to what I really like - Frontend development. 

I was always able to find reliable information and solutions for different issues. I am capable of completing projects successfully. For example, my first experience in launching website - [meteotur.ru](http://www.meteotur.ru/index.php).

In the short term, my goal is to improve my knowledge, skills and achievements to the level required for a Junior Developer. 

In the long term I want to get job in growing IT company, to take a part in projects and as result of my own development to lead one of them.
